## What is `assess-gtfs`?

[General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)][gtfs] is a common data format for
public transit information. GTFS is a prerequisite for undertaking routing
with public transit schedules.

The `assess-gtfs` Python package helps to reduce barriers to understanding the
service distribution within GTFS. More specifically, it enables developers to
inspect, clean and process GTFS for more efficient, localised routing analysis.

### The History of `assess-gtfs`

`assess-gtfs` started out life as a module in the ONS Data Science Campus'
[`transport_performance`][tp] package. `assess-gtfs` is built upon and inspired
by the excellent [gtfs_kit][gtfskit] package. `assess-gtfs` was needed to
process and inspect GTFS data prior to building transport networks with the
[r<sup>5</sup>py][r5py] package. Building valid transit networks with the
output of our GTFS processing pipelines has been the primary user requirement
during development.
