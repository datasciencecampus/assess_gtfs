## What is `transport_performance`?

The performance of transport networks are highly variable throughout and
between countries. There is often a lack of consistent and comparable data
which can make it difficult to understand these differences. This is typically
because of computational complexity, transparency (closed-source and paid
services), and data consistency (format and availability).

The `transport_performance` Python package helps to reduce barriers to
transport analysis. It allows developers to:

- Define an [urban centre] boundary based on population density;
- Inspect, clean, and process [public transit timetable data][gtfs] and
[OpenStreetMap data][osm]; and
- Conduct [multimodal routing][r5py] and calculate a range of
[transport metrics][eurostat-paper].

Check out the [transport performance Docker image][tp-docker] üê≥!
This aims to simplify the dependency installation and end-to-end use of
`transport_performance`.

## Notes on contributing...

We hope that the open source and public sector communities will collaborate and
build on this package. This will help improve both the national and
international comparability of transport statistics while enabling higher
frequency and more timely comparisons. You can find the `transport_performance`
source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/transport-network-performance).
