# This workflow will install Python dependencies and run only integration tests
# This is a standalone runner such that if integration testing fails it does not
#Â impact other runners.
# Fixing OS version to avoid breaking OS changes during development stage.
# Will open up OS versions before release.
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
