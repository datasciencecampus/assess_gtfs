These explanation pages provide an understanding of the `assess-gtfs` package.

`assess-gtfs` allows users to validate, clean, inspect and filter transit
timetable data in the [General Transit Feed Specification](gtfs-spec) (GTFS)
format.

## What is GTFS

GTFS files are compressed zip archives of text files. Each text file containing
information about routes, trips, calendar, stop locations and so on. Various
transport modelling software are able to use these files as a relational
database in order to undertake routing operations.

Below are the file contents of a small sample of UK GTFS.
